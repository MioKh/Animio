# Animio
This project dives into APIs and data fetching to create a platform for exploring popular anime and manga. Users can easily search and access details on their favorite titles.

## Getting Started 
so have a general idea how is this gonna work , and i dont think it should be that hard but lets see what happens for now this is the order in my brain 

seems simple enough but i need to figure out how to do that :D

jikan API documentation : https://docs.api.jikan.moe/  seems a good place to start


## Progress so far

- [x] Created the basic layout of the website (kinda hardcoded, will change later)
- [x] Added styling to the website
- [ ] Read the Jikan API documentation and started fetching data from the API
- [ ] Displaying the data on the website
