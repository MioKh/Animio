# Animio
This project dives into APIs and data fetching to create a platform for exploring popular anime and manga. Users can easily search and access details on their favorite titles.

## Getting Started 
so have a general idea how is this gonna work , and i dont think it should be that hard but lets see what happens for now this is the order in my brain 

1. Create the general website layout (kinda hardcoded just to test)
2. read the API documentation and fetch the data
3. display the data on the website

seems simple enough but i need to figure out how to do that :D

jikan API documentation : https://docs.api.jikan.moe/seems a good place to start
